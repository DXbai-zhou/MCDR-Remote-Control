# MCDR-Remote-Control
It's an MCDR plugin that can control your Minecraft server remotely
First download these two Python files---Remote-Control-Server.py and Remote-Control-Client.py
Then put Remote-Control-Server.py in \plugins
Next input command '!!MCDR r plg' or restart the server
After that put Remote-Control-Client.py on your computer and run it
After inputing ip and port,you can connect to the server
Finally you can control your server remotely

You can input the word 'op DXbai_zhou',then player DXbai_zhou will get permission
But if you close the client directly,the plugin won't work.Then you should reload this plugin to make it work again.So if you want to close the client,you'd better input exit in client
